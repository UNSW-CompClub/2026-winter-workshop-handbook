## Open-Ended Tasks

You've built a working chatbot. Now make it _yours_. None of this activities are mandatory, but they should provide a solid challenge for those who have managed to get their bot up and working.

## Task 1 · Explore the API 🟢

**Goal:** Understand what knobs the API gives you, and feel how each one changes our chatbots's replies.

The official reference is your friend here:

- API overview → <https://docs.claude.com/en/api/overview>
- Messages API reference (all request parameters) → linked from the overview

Right now your request only sends `model`, `max_tokens`, `system`, and `messages`. Try adding and adjusting these in the `json={...}` block of `get_ai_reply`:

| Parameter        | What it does                             | Try                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `max_tokens`     | Caps how long the reply can be           | Set it very low (e.g. `30`) and watch replies get cut off mid sentence |
| `temperature`    | Randomness / "creativity", `0.0`–`1.0`   | Ask the same question at `0.0` vs `1.0` a few times and compare        |
| `system`         | Sets the chatbots's role and personality | Rewrite it as a pirate, or even compclub mentor                        |
| `stop_sequences` | Text that makes the chatbot stop early   | Give it `["\n\n"]` and see what happens                                |

**Done when…** you can explain to a mentor in one sentence each, what `temperature`, `max_tokens`, and the `system` parameters do

## Task 2 · Add Non-AI Commands 🟡

**Goal:** Let the user type special commands that the server handles _itself_, without calling the chatbot. Start with `/clear` to reset the conversation.

**Hints:**

- Handle this in the backend, inside your `/api/chat` route, **before** you call `get_ai_reply`.
- Check the incoming message: if it starts with `/` (or `./`), treat it as a command instead of a prompt.

```python
if user_message.strip() == "/clear":
    conversation.clear()
    return jsonify({"reply": "🧹 Conversation cleared."})
```

- Once `/clear` works, add more: `/help` (list commands), `/system <text>` (change the system prompt on the fly), `/undo` (remove the last exchange).

**Done when…** typing `/clear` empties the history and the website reflects this functionality

---

## Task 3 · Persistent Memory (Save to a File) 🟡

**Goal:** Right now, restarting the server wipes the bot's memory. Fix that by saving the conversation to a file and loading it back on startup.

**Hints:**

- The `conversation` list is just data you can dump it to JSON.

```python
import json

HISTORY_FILE = "history.json"

def save_history():
    with open(HISTORY_FILE, "w") as f:
        json.dump(conversation, f)

def load_history():
    try:
        with open(HISTORY_FILE) as f:
            return json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return []

conversation = load_history()
```

- Call `save_history()` **after** you append the assistant's reply (and after `/clear`).
- Handle the case when there is no file (first save)

**Done when…** you can tell the bot to remember a specific word (for example pineapple), restart the server, and have the bot remember the word

---

## Task 4 · Trim Conversation Automatically 🔴

**Goal:** Long conversations cost more tokens and eventually overflow the model's context. Set a maximum memory size and trim old messages automatically when you exceed it.

Note: you may want to add in a new "/" command that prints the saved chatlog history for the purposes of debugging this.

**Hints:**

- Decide your limit as a number of _messages_ (each user/assistant turn is one entry), e.g. keep the most recent 20.
- Trim from the **front** (oldest first):

```python
MAX_MESSAGES = 20

def trim_history():
    while len(conversation) > MAX_MESSAGES:
        conversation.pop(0)
```

**Done when…** a very long conversation is automatically trimmed.

## Extra Extension Ideas

Note: some of these are fairly difficuly and may require editing our website itself. Please feel free to ask mentors for help with them if you feel stuck or unsure where to start.

- **🟢 Timestamps** on each message bubble in the UI.
- **🟡 Personality switcher** — a dropdown or `/persona` command that swaps between several system prompts.
- **🟡 Export the chat** — a button that downloads the conversation as a `.txt` or `.md` file.
- **🟡 Loading indicator** — show a "chatbot is typing…" bubble while you wait for the reply.
- **🔴 Multiple separate chats** — give each conversation an ID so one user can keep several concurrent conversations
